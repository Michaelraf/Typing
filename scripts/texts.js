        title: "The Library of Babel",
        writer: "Jorge Luis Borges",
        history: "The world is a library that contains all the books that have ever been written, but most of them are indecipherable. Many people venture to the library to find the meaning of life. It reminded me of Terry Pratchett's Discworld library. \"Perhaps my old age and fearfulness deceive me, but I suspect that the human species the unique species is about to be extinguished, but the Library will endure: illuminated, solitary, infinite, perfectly motionless, equipped with precious volumes, useless, incorruptible, secret.\""

        title: "In The Penal Colony",
        writer: "Franz Kafka",
        history: "It's a chilling story. A man known as the Traveller is visiting a foreign penal colony where he is shown a special machine used to execute prisoners. The machine inscribes the prisoner's crime onto their body until they die (kind of sounds familiar if you've read the fifth Harry Potter book). It takes twelve hours of torture before the prisoner dies. I told you it was chilling!"

        title:"The Fruit Of My Woman",
        writer:"Han Kang (Granta)",
        history:"This story was written in 1997 before the publication of The Vegetarian. The two stories share many of the same themes, and it's evident that this story served as a blueprint for the later book. In \"The Fruit of My Woman\" the wife is slowly turning into a tree (something that also comes up in The Vegetarian). The allusions to Daphne turning herself into a laurel tree to escape the advances of Apollo are hard to miss, but there's no clear indication that Daphne was an actual influence on either story. Han Kang can do no wrong in my eyes."
